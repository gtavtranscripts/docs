> <span className="franklin">Franklin</span> receives a call from <span className="simeon">Simeon.</span>

<span className="simeon">Simeon:</span> Franklin!  

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Eh, what's going down, homie?  

<span className="simeon">Simeon:</span> The market, my boy. Liquidity's a bitch. Get over here so I can give you the new repo list.  

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Alright, I'll be around when I get a chance.  

<Note>
  This conversation will be available after Franklin damaged the car in previous mission.
</Note>

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Hey, what's going down, Simeon?  

<span className="simeon">Simeon:</span> Franklin, I must ask you: the last car you repossessed, it was in a terrible state. Was that how you found it?

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Uhh, yeah, man. The dude wrecked it.  

<span className="simeon">Simeon:</span> Ah, that's all I need to know for the insurance men. Come to the dealership, I have something to show you.  

> <span className="franklin">Franklin</span> walks into the showroom.

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Hey, what's up, Simeon?  

<span className="simeon">Simeon:</span> My dear boy. So good to see you. So good. Hold me.  

> <span className="simeon">Simeon</span> embraces <span className="franklin">Franklin</span> for a moment before being pushed away.

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Yeah, look, man... Look, we've been working together for about a few months now, right?  

<span className="simeon">Simeon:</span> Which is why I am very honored to announce to you... that you... are Employee of the Month.  

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Huh?  

<span className="simeon">Simeon:</span> Anyway, congratulations! It wasn't easy picking a winner.  

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Yeah, me, Lamar, your nephew Sacha with the twitch. Look, man. It's been a real honor, homie, but I gotta move forward in my life. It seem like all I do is let people tell me what to do and I do it and nothing changes.  

<span className="simeon">Simeon:</span> I tell you what, my boy, you tell me exactly what you want, and I will very carefully explain to you why it cannot be.  

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> What?  

<span className="simeon">Simeon:</span> Today is repossessing vehicles that fools have purchased at exorbitant interest rates. But tomorrow... Together! I never had a black son, but if I did I want him to be just like you.  

> <span className="lamar">Lamar</span> interrupts the conversation.

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> Knock knock, ni**as!  

<span className="simeon">Simeon:</span> Hello, Lamar!  

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> What's up, Simeon? What's up, homie? What's happening, homie?  

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Sup, dog?  

<span className="simeon">Simeon:</span> Franklin here has been awarded Employee of the Month.  

> <span className="lamar">Lamar</span> stares indignantly at the award hanging on the wall.

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> You fucking with me, right?  

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Man, we both being fucked with, dog.    

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> Man, knock it off, man. For real? After all the motherfucking work I put in, man?  

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Man, fuck this Employee of the Month shit, homie. I'm sitting up here trying to get us...  
 
<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> 
What do you mean, "fuck this Employee of the Month shit", man? When there's some shit to be won, Goddamnit, I want it. I don't give a fuck what it is. Y'know what I'm talkin' about? I take no prisoners. I go hard doing this shit. Big dog. Big nuts. When names is on a motherfuckin' board I want to see my name at the top of that motherfucker and next to it, it need to say "Winner".  

<span className="simeon">Simeon:</span> Maybe next month, huh?  

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> Man, fuck next month, Simeon. What about today? I-I demand a retrial.  

<span className="simeon">Simeon:</span> Today is nothing, just a bike. Hasn't made a payment at all. Some kid at Vespucci Beach. His name is Esteban Jimenez.  

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Is he in a gang?  

<span className="simeon">Simeon:</span> Curiously enough, I did not inquire when he bought the bike.  

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> We got work to do, err... Employee of the Month. 

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Man, fuck you, and come on.  

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> Man, you's about a "yes master"-ass ni**a.  

> <span className="franklin">Franklin</span> and <span className="lamar">Lamar</span> leave the showroom and enter a car.

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> What we waiting for? Magellan Ave., ni**a. Vespucci Beach.

> On the way out, <span className="franklin">Franklin</span> and <span className="lamar">Lamar</span> comment about the former's hairstyle.

**Lamar - If the player didn't change Franklin's hairstyle**
<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> Hey, you still rollin' with that old raggedy ass hair? That country bumpkin shit is enough to get us shot right there.  

**Lamar - If the player changed Franklin's hairstyle**
<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> At least you had that old raggedy ass hair restyled, I was about to have to drop your ass.  

**Franklin - If the player didn't change Franklin's hairstyle**
<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> I never took you to be all hair stylist-type bitch, but now it's all starting to make sense.  

**Franklin - If the player changed Franklin's hairstyle**
<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Man, fuck you, ni**a, I wish I had any cutting.

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Hey, wasn't that motherfucker who took the bike that ese - Vagos dude? With the tattoo on his face and shit?

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> Yeah, that was him.

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Fuck, homie, I don't want no unnecessary bullshit here, alright?

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> Ni**a, I don't give a shit. There's a reason Simeon pays a couple of mean looking motherfuckers to come repo this shit. We ain't girl scouts.

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> In your case, I ain't so sure about that.

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> Man, step up, ni**a! Of course this dude real. Who else is gonna have the required surplus of paper, and deficiency of brain cells? He just put a dub down on this bike.

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Twenty Gs?

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> With a three G note!

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Man, that motherfucker must be tricked out, dog.

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> Man, this whole setup designed to take drug money.

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Alright, man, look, we go in quiet. In and out, no fuckin' drama.

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> I'll try, homie. But I'm one loud, dramatic, brash, crazy, greedy, shoot a motherfucker in the back type motherfucker. And you love me for it, ni**a.

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> That's right, homie. Nothing but love, ni**a.

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> That Simeon a funny dude though, huh? It's gonna be a shame when we get to book his ass and jack him for all this shit.

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> What the fuck you talking about? You a psychotic motherfucker.

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> That's how shit work, ain't it? You do some jobs for a fool, develop a little uneasy relationship, and then they ask you to do something above and beyond, you fall out, fools get capped, then you start all over again with some other fool.

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Where the fuck you get that from? That ain't my life, dummy.

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> How 'bout the boy with the eye, from 'round the way? Marcus, or somethin'? You was slanging for him and then he got what was comin', right?

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> That was different. That dude had it coming.

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> I don't wanna clap my boy Yetarian either, I like homie. This just smacks of the inevitable.

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> Look, dog, this time we legit, homie. This honest work, it's gonna end up with us coming up in the world.

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> Oh, really? That's a nice change from fools comin' up on us.

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> That's trill, homie.

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> You damn right that's trill, partner, but it's a shame I don't believe it. You wanna drop some notes on that shit, I'll give you the odds, homie.

<span className="franklin">Franklin:</span> You Apache motherfuckers love your bets, huh? You should go work on one of them reservation casinos, only they'd kick yo' ass out for being a fradulent imposter, motherfucker.

<span className="lamar">Lamar:</span> You and all yo' little racial stereotypes and shit? I find 'em offensive. I'm very sensitive to your intolerance, my ni**a.
